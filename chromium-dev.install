${green}==>${all_off} ${bold}This Chromium package no longer supports custom flags passed via the
   '/etc/chromium/default' file (or any other files under '/etc/chromium/').
  ${blue}->${all_off} The new '${bold}/usr/bin/chromium-dev${all_off}' launcher script will automatically detect
     Pepper Flash (if installed) and pass the correct flags to Chromium.'
  ${blue}->${all_off} If you need to pass extra command-line arguments to Chromium, you
     can put them in the '${bold}chromium-dev-flags.conf${all_off}' file under '${bold}\x24HOME/.config/'${all_off}
     (or ${bold}\x24XDG_CONFIG_HOME${all_off}). Arguments are split on whitespace and shell
     quoting rules apply but no further parsing is performed.
${green}==>${all_off} ${bold}If you use Kwallet5 from Plasma/Kf5:${all_off}
  ${blue}->${all_off} You needs add '${bold}\"--password-store=kwallet5\"${all_off}' into '${bold}chromium-dev-flags.conf${all_off}' file
     under '${bold}\x24HOME/.config/${all_off}' (or ${bold}\x24XDG_CONFIG_HOME${all_off}).
${green}==>${all_off} ${bold}If you GPU can decode videos with resolution more than 1920x1088:${all_off}
  ${blue}->${all_off} You can change this value (hardcoded in the code) setting it into the '${bold}va_fallback_resolution${all_off}' file
     under '${bold}/etc/chromium-dev/${all_off}' with this content (must be integers numbers):
     '${bold}Width  Height+8${all_off}'
     in the first line, in that order (notice this need have ${bold}two spaces${all_off} between two integers). For example:
     '${bold}4032  4088${all_off}'.
     You can know this values running '${bold}vdpauinfo${all_off}' command.
